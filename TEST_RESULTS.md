# Test Results - Initial Assessment

## 🔐 Authentication Flow Tests

### ❌ Test Case 1: Sign Up Process
**Status**: PARTIAL - Works but has debug data
**Issues Found**:
- Form has pre-filled test data (needs to be cleaned)
- Validation logic was temporarily disabled
- Form works but needs proper validation restored

### ❌ Test Case 2: Sign In Process  
**Status**: FAIL - Button disabled due to validation issue
**Issues Found**:
- `handleInputChange` doesn't run validation
- Button stays disabled because `isValid` remains false
- Same validation pattern issue as signup

### ❌ Test Case 3: Authentication State Management
**Status**: UNKNOWN - Can't test due to signin failure

## 🧭 Navigation & Routing Tests

### 🔄 Test Case 4-6: Navigation Tests
**Status**: PENDING - Can't test without working authentication

## Critical Issues to Fix Immediately:

### Priority 1: Authentication (BLOCKING)
1. **SignIn form validation** - Button disabled, can't sign in
2. **SignUp form cleanup** - Remove test data, restore validation
3. **Authentication state** - Test session management

### Priority 2: Basic Functionality  
4. **Navigation testing** - Once auth works
5. **Protected route testing** - Once auth works
6. **Dashboard loading** - Test core pages

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
7. **Repository integration** - Test once core works
8. **AI chat** - Test once core works
